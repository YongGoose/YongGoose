## A developer passionate about learning, sharing, and building impactful software.

I'm a Junior backend engineer and open source contributor(my hobby) on `JUnit5`, `apache/seata`, `naver/fixture-monkey`, and more. Currently a [committer](https://people.apache.org/phonebook.html?uid=yongjunh) for `apache/seata`, and selected as a [GSoC'25 contributor](https://community.gradle.org/events/gsoc/2025/maven-central-publishing-with-new-api/) for a `Kotlin & Gradle` project.  
Enjoy collaborating on projects, sharing knowledge, and continuously learning new technologies to improve my skills.  

Recently, I’ve been particularly interested in [**Test code**](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/2024-09-24-comming-soon/271981415).  
Test code is not just for validation; It also helps other developers understand how to use my code and serves as a guide for efficient refactoring, making it crucial for maintaining high-quality software.

I'm also exploring **distributed transactions**, especially their implementation and challenges in microservices architectures. It's a complex but fascinating area, and I’ve been sharing my thoughts in recent blog posts.
